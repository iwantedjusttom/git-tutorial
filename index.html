  <h1>The best way to learn is to teach... yourself!</h1>

  <h2>Ok, let's talk git hub</h2>
  <p> I want to start out just talking about how to get started.<br>
      So, I am starting a brand new deal here.<br>
      The first thing that I'm doing is initializing git in this directory. I copied the directory in to
      the terminal and now I'm in the directory. I used the command cd (for change directory)
      and pasted it in. <br>
      That ended up not working. I went up a level by using cd .. and then used ls to see what was
      available.<br>
      after that I was able to get in to the directory - but I did have to use cd 'git tutorial'
      for it to work because I put a space in there.<br>
      <br>
      Now I have to remember how to get it up to github
  </p>
  <p>So after git init in the terminal you can git add your file - make sure you either add the name
    or add a . to add all files that had a change. Then you git commit and it saves your files.</p>
  <p>make sure to add a message along with it with -m and use one '' in terminal on a mac to get it
  to save a message along with your commit. That way, when you want to remember what you did you
  have a way to do that</p>

  <p>I forgot to mention, if you want to see what files have been updated in the directory you
    can type git status and it will show you what things have been added. In terminal they will
    show up red if they haven't been added already to the stage and they will be green if they
    have been staged.</p>

  <h3>So how do you look at commits</h3>
  <p>Well, right now all I remember is using git checkout and then whatever the commit code is.</p>
  <p>You can also look at git log to see all of the commits. If you want to see a concise
  verion of all that information you can use git log --oneline and it will just show you the
  code and the message.</p>

  <h3>Ok so you have yourself a commit</h3>
  <p>Let's get the repo from github down here so we can send stuff up there.</p>
