  <h1>The best way to learn is to teach... yourself!</h1>

  <h2>Ok, let's talk git hub</h2>
  <p> I want to start out just talking about how to get started.<br>
      So, I am starting a brand new deal here.<br>
      The first thing that I'm doing is initializing git in this directory. I copied the directory in to
      the terminal and now I'm in the directory. I used the command cd (for change directory)
      and pasted it in. <br>
      That ended up not working. I went up a level by using cd .. and then used ls to see what was
      available.<br>
      after that I was able to get in to the directory - but I did have to use cd 'git tutorial'
      for it to work because I put a space in there.<br>
      <br>
      Now I have to remember how to get it up to github
  </p>
  <p>So after git init in the terminal you can git add your file - make sure you either add the name
    or add a . to add all files that had a change. Then you git commit and it saves your files.</p>
  <p>make sure to add a message along with it with -m and use one '' in terminal on a mac to get it
  to save a message along with your commit. That way, when you want to remember what you did you
  have a way to do that</p>

  <p>I forgot to mention, if you want to see what files have been updated in the directory you
    can type git status and it will show you what things have been added. In terminal they will
    show up red if they haven't been added already to the stage and they will be green if they
    have been staged.</p>

  <h3>So how do you look at commits</h3>
  <p>Well, right now all I remember is using git checkout and then whatever the commit code is.</p>
  <p>You can also look at git log to see all of the commits. If you want to see a concise
  verion of all that information you can use git log --oneline and it will just show you the
  code and the message.</p>

  <h3>Ok so you have yourself a commit</h3>
  <p>Let's get the repo from github down here so we can send stuff up there.</p>
  <p>since we already initiated the repo on git locally, we are going to have to <!DOCTYPE html>
  this a certain way.</p>


  <p>so to do this you have to do a couple of things<br></p>

    <ul>
    <li>git remote add origin https://github.com/iwantedjusttom/git-tutorial.git</li>
    <li>git push -u origin master</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is what these lines from above mean for you when you are adding something to a github repo</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the first thing creates an alias called origin that connects it to the github repository</li>
    <li>the next line then pushes the local repo up to the master branch of the github repo</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>branches</h3>

  <p> branches are really important because they allow you to take the code that you have been
    working on and start a new version of it</p>
  <p>to start a new branch all you have to do is git branch [name]<br>
  Then if you want to delete a branch you can use git branch -d or -D and then the name
of the branch</p>
  <p> to change which branch you're on you use the same thing to look at different commits git checkout [branch name]
    </p>

  <h3>getting branches up to github</h3>
  <p>So to get something up to github all you have to do is make sure that you're on the right branch
    (not the master) and then do git push alias and then the branch name</p>
  <p>you don't ever want to push with the master or edit the master on github because everyone is using import it,
    you want to keep it as consistent as possible</p>
